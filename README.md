# NF_IDS: NetFlow-based IDS

This is an simple web server that serves a trained NetFlow-based IDS. This IDS can detect malicious netflow records and return a malicious score for each record üòç. `NF_IDS` can be used with [pinanek23/flow-preprocessing-and-enrichment](https://github.com/pinanek23/flow-preprocessing-and-enrichment), an enrichment system that can enrich the output of `NF_IDS` with additional information.

## Setup

- Setup virtual environment

```console
vscode@Ubuntu:~/project/flow-based-IDS$ pip -m venv .env
vscode@Ubuntu:~/project/flow-based-IDS$ source .env/bin/activate
(.env) vscode@Ubuntu:~/project/flow-based-IDS$
```
